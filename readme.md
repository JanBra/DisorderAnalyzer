This is the github repository of the bachelor thesis "" by Jan-Philipp Bramkamp.
The code and data used for the thesis can be found in this repository.
There is a little help for the first use of the program in german in the appendix of the thesis. Other than that I tried to make the "help" option of the program as helpful as possible.
Therefore you should try using "DisorderAnalyzer.py --help" or "DisorderAnalyzer.py {analyze/update} --help" to get some extra information.
